Please Download zip file called "Auto Accept"

When running, leave on main monitor and do not cover the game or it can't search. May not work on smaller or bigger resolutions than 1920x1080.
The way this works is by searching for an image detection for when the queue pops and then issues the "enter" keystroke. (this also means that if it thinks its detecting it, it'll continue to hit enter so make sure to turn it off after match accepted.)

To use:
	1. Open app via "Main.exe"
	2. Select character	(It will not select your build. The top most build be defaulted)
	3. Click "Game Start"
	

Future changes:
	work in window.
	add threading for optimization.


Version 2.0


Please note, there might be a false positive coming from certain anti-viruses due to how the compiler i use to freeze the code. I am looking into this.
