When running, leave on main monitor and do not cover the game or it can't search. May not work on smaller or bigger resolutions than 1920x1080.
The way this works is by searching for an image detection for when the queue pops and then issues the "enter" keystroke. (this also means that if it thinks its detecting it, it'll continue to hit enter so make sure to turn it off after match accepted.)

To use:
	1. Open app via "Main.exe"
	3. Select character
	2. Click "Game Start"
	Please keep in mind that this will not select the build for you. You will end up using whatever is in your top slot.


Future changes:
	work in window.
	add threading for optimization.
